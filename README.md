# arctanh.cc

## Introduction

This is the source code repository for my personal website, hosted at [arctanh.cc](https://arctanh.cc/). You can find my (beginner-level) HTML and CSS here in various locations. Domain management by Cloudflare, hosting by GitHub. Not much else to say.

## License

My website and all content contained within is free and open source, licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3). You are entitled to copy, steal, rebrand, change, update, break, or otherwise mess with anything in this repository, so long as you follow the conditions outlined in the license. That pretty much just means you have to keep your new code open source, state the changes you make, etc. Check the `COPYING` file for more details.

## Contact

Questions, comments, support, etc. should probably be kept to yourself. If that is for some reason impossible, you can get in touch with me at `me@arctanh.cc`, though I can't promise a timely update. This is purely hobbyist, after all! Critiques and recommendations are appreciated, even still, but please understand that you will probably need to explain things to me like a four year-old.
