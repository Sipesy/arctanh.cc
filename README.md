## Introduction

This is the source code repository for my personal website, hosted at [arctanh.cc](https://arctanh.cc/). You can find my (beginner-level) HTML and CSS here in various locations. Not much else to say.

## License

My website and all content contained within is free and open source, licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3). You are entitled to copy, steal, rebrand, change, update, break, or otherwise mess with anything in this repository, so long as you follow the conditions outlined in the license. That pretty much just means you have to keep your new code open source, state the changes you make, etc. Check the `COPYING` file for more details.

## Contact

Questions, comments, support, etc. should probably be kept to yourself. If that is for some reason impossible, get in touch with me at `me@arctanh.cc`.
