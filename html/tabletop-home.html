				<h2>Home Page</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to the home page of my built-from-scratch tabletop RPG. This page will give an overview of what my game is, why I'm making it, and any major updates on recent progress. If you specific interests, hover over the <i>Tabletop</i> tab or travel to the <a href="tabletop.html">Hub</a> for the blog and some more specific links to interior pages.

				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					Essentially, the fundamental idea for this RPG is the inclusion of additional mechanics and playstyles that don't fit into the framework of D&D. I wanted to be able to bring in outside ideas that I really liked from other media and have them interact clearly and seamlessly with other mechanics in-game. Beyond that, there are several things I'm not too much a fan of mechanically in D&D (Armor Class for one). I wanted to come up with a system that allowed me to find or create mechanics that I liked better. Those thoughts, plus the love I have of world-building drove me to undertake this huge project which has been years in the making at this point.
