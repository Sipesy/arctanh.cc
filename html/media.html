			there are lots of good things on the 'net to listen to. more pops up every day, hard to keep up with it all. but here are a few things that i've been liking lately
			<h2>audiobooks</h2>
			<h3><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17268007W/Annihilation?edition=key%3A/books/OL25841044M">Annihilation, by Jeff VanderMeet</a></h3>
			<p><i>Annihilation</i> has been on my reading list for quite a while. i love the visuals and cinematography of the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/300668-annihilation">film of the same name</a>, and have been interested in learning more about the area the movie calls "the shimmer" (rather uninspiringly titled "Area X" in the book). the broken, anomolous nature of the space was captivating, and listening to it as the author orginally wrote it has been fasinating so far. no names, just titles. secrets and plots abound. a mysterious moaning, a tunnel that may be more than it seems. and all packed into a rather short listen (for an audiobook).</p>

			<h3><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24550547W/The_Backyard_Adventurer?edition=key%3A/books/OL32546338M">The Backyard Adventurer, by Beau Miles</a></h3>
			<p>Beau Miles, of youtube fame, has written a book detailing how his philosophy in adventuring has changed over the years, including much autobiographical meandering through his younger years and the experiences he's had. Beau's laid-back demeanor and use of his famous "Beau-isms" keeps the book flowing through his many anecdotes and life lessons. Beau is always authentic, but he's even more so in his writing, showing vulnerability that isn't always apparent in his video work. it's been a great listen so far!</p>
