<p>howdy,</p>
<p>welcome to the second official fancy blog post on this website! truly a monumental achievement. can you believe i’m putting off actually important school work for this? me neither! anyway, on to the important stuff: thanks to heretofore unknown capabilities of my mail client, i was able to register an email under this domain. it’s pretty much just a glorified alias, but it works and allows me to send and receive email for this website! i was pretty excited about it.</p>
<p>it uses <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> as a backend, so if anyone that also has an account with them gets in touch, rest assured that all communications are encrytped E2E. not that we’ll have anything too delicate to talk about in all likelihood, but cool nonetheless.</p>
<p>let’s see, what else is new? getting married at the end of the month, so that’s fun. going to be changing my name and all! glad i didn’t buy a domain tied to my real name. that’d be awkward. also, still trying to push through some school shizz, getting a bit worn down from constantly going, but once this class is done, should be able to take a break, thankfully. not for long, though! gotta keep things rolling so that we get into student teaching on time and graduate on time. for something that’s actually going well and working out great, it’s sure really exhausting.</p>
<p>hoping for a bit more “real” spring coming up. it’s been cold and wet lately, tons of bad weather, even some tornados. want to get a bit more warmth to maybe get back to doing some birding, spending more time outside, all the good stuff. being sick hasn’t helped that either, i guess. been a few good days for running and biking that i’ve had to skip on because of sick. bit of a bummer. ah well, gotta keep rolling with the punches, i guess. in any case, that’s gonna wrap up this post. i really should get back to doing some actual work at some point.</p>
