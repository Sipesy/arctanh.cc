<p>yo yo yo,</p>
<p>welcome back cool cats and kittens, we’re here another exciting life update: we just got married! yep, it’s kind of a big deal. those few eagle-eyed viewers will notice a gap of around a month between the previous update and this one. i’d like to blame the wedding for that, but really it’s just a lack of much to say. well, that and the utter absence of any sort of posting habit. i’ll work on it. anyway, the important thing is that we just had our wedding ceremony a week ago today! in fact, as of writing, it hasn’t even been quite a full week, since the ceremony didn’t start until a mite after two thirty.</p>
<p>that day was so incredibly stressful. not least because i forgot i was the one picking up the flowers. luckily, someone else was able to take care of it and my (now) wife was able to look past that grievous error and go on with the wedding! i can tell you that i felt absolutely awful, though. aside from that and some worry about the photographer sticking around for long enough, it was a pretty beautiful ceremony. (is that a cliché? does everyone say that about their wedding?) the temperature was great, some cloud cover kept the sun out of our eyes, nearly everyone showed up, and basically everything went off without a hitch once the flowers arrived. i was waaaay more of an emotional wreck than i expected to be, tears steaming and snot bubbling out of my nose all through my vows. yuck! she looked great, though! and i feel like i get a pass for being a blubbering mess on my own damn wedding day, right?</p>
<p>on to the <em>really</em> important details: the food! we had a caterer from Rachel’s mom’s church come out to do it, which we both weren’t sure about at first, but it turned out to be pretty darn good. penne alfredo and ravioli in marinara with roasted chicken, green beans, and rolls to go along. sure, the ravioli was a little bland, but the alfredo was (is– dear god we have so many leftovers) pretty bangin’. and you know that i’ll always love some warm bread. we had some lovely wine pairings too. just kidding, i don’t think anyone even had wine! but we did pop some champagne, passed out some sparkling cider, and several folks partook in beer and punch. the cake was great, too, lemon with raspberry jam filling, coated in cream cheese-buttercream icing! a costco cake served well the masses (and, according to my wife, may have been even better than the wedding cake).</p>
<p>us being us, we stayed until pretty much everyone else had left, even though we didn’t help too much with cleanup. we ended up scootin’ at around eight pm, which got us to our cabin just before nine. once there, we shed our bags and our wedding regalia to enjoy the hot tub– the one amenity we set as a must for our mini-moon. the scorching temps (for april) and abundance of alcohol (and accompanying scarcity of water) in our systems meant we couldn’t stay in for too long, but we were exhausted anyway.</p>
<p>all in all, it was a lovely time. a whirlwind, yes (it mostly felt like a waking dream), but nice. we both ended up taking off an extra day to recover once we got home. and alas, the stresses are not yet over. we’re still paying off some stuff from the weekend, have less money in our shared account than we’d prefer, and have hardly gotten a full night’s sleep in over a month. looking forward to therapy sometime this week, that’s for sure~</p>
<p>it’s not <em>all</em> been wedding stuff since the last update, though. been letting slide my school work, perhaps a bit too much and need to get caught up, but i’m still able to see the light at the end of the tunnel: five more courses to knock out this summer, a content test, and then student teaching in the fall. it’s really looking like one more school year (at work) before i move into a position as a full-blown intervention specialist! wow! some big stresses, big changes, and big pay rises coming my way! i really think i’ll like my job, especially since i’ll be somewhat close to my current coworkers and in a similar position. it’s really been great having so much support from the team and so many strong recommendations throughout this process. when do you think it will actually feel like reality? probably not until after my first day, or week or month or year, maybe.</p>
<p>oh, and speaking of work and great timing, the day before my wedding just so happened to be our annual reunion prom. that whole week was focused on set-up, and included several days of doing things after work, like transport and initial decoration work. but i’lll be damned if it wasn’t a blast and so hard to step away from friday night, despite my responsibilities the next day. prom is probably one of my favorite times of the year, though there is some bitter to go along with the sweetness: it signifies the fact that the year is nearly over, that we’ll be saying goodbye to many of our students and sometimes even one another. it’s one of those things that makes you so happy that the ending of it hurts. it’s that thing whose absence fills you with sorrow because the joy that came with it is also gone. mm. might be getting a little too in-the-weeds for this particular post. gonna make myself too sad to be productive today! that makes me think this is a good point to wrap up for now.</p>
<p>’til next time!</p>
